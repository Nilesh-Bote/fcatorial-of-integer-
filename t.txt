Explanation:
HTML:
The interface consists of a title, a text input field to enter a number, a button to trigger the calculation, and sections to display both the iterative and recursive results.
CSS:
Basic styling is applied for a clean, simple, and centered layout.
JavaScript:
Two functions, factorialIterative and factorialRecursive, compute the factorial using the iterative and recursive methods respectively.
The function isValidInput checks if the input is a valid positive integer.
The button click event listener retrieves the user input, validates it, and then computes the factorials using both methods. The results are displayed in the HTML
